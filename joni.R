# DESCRIPTION ------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# JONI by rjhj, https://github.com/rjhj/joni
#
# A data wrangling exercise with Joni Mitchell albums using R's data.table.
#
# The original HTML tables from Wikipedia are transformed to tidy and usable
# data.tables. See README.md for screenshots and more information.

# LIBRARIES --------------------------------------------------------------------

library(data.table) # Enhanced data.frame
library(rvest) # For web scraping and HTML element manipulations
library(stringr) # For string manipulation

# CONSTANTS---------------------------------------------------------------------
# All constants are CAPITALIZED for clarity

# Website where to find the tables. Backup html is in the files folder
URL = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_Mitchell_discography"

# There are 12 tables on the website:
#     1. Info box
#     2. Studio albums,  
#     3. Live albums
#     4. Compilation albums
#     5. Extended plays
#     6. Singles
#     7. Guest singles
#     8. Video albums
#     9. Music videos
#    10. Navigation box
#    11. Archives series
#    12. Collaborations
# I only want to use 2. Studio, 3. Live, 4. Compilation and 6. Singles
ALBUM_POSITIONS = c(
  'studio'= 2L,
  'live' = 3L,
  'compilation' = 4L,
  'single' = 6L
)

# TURN URL TO RELEVANT HTML TABLES ---------------------------------------------
# We only want html tables for studio, live, compilation and single

html_tables <- read_html(URL) |> # Read html from URL
  html_elements("table") # Find all <table> elements

html_tables <- html_tables[ALBUM_POSITIONS] # Choose only relevant tables

# Name the list using names given in ALBUM_POSITIONS dictionary
names(html_tables) <- names(ALBUM_POSITIONS)

# CONVERT THE HTML TABLES TO DATA.TABLES----------------------------------------

html_table_to_dt <- function(html_table){
  # Converts the html table into a data.frame
  #
  # Args:
  #   html_table: HTML containing <table...>..</tbody>
  #
  # Returns:
  #   data.table
  return(
    html_table |> # Variable containing html table 
      html_table() |> # Parses the html table in a data frame
      as.data.table() # Coerces the data.frame to data.table
  )
}

# Apply the html to data.table conversion to all the html tables
albums = lapply(html_tables, html_table_to_dt)

# Notice that after this point one can view different albums with commands like:
#
# albums[["studio"]]
# or
# View(albums[["studio"]])
#
# I didn't create different variables for each table, because that could cause
# some errors especially when doing other than assignments by reference 

# Albums are fairly uniform, but the last columns of "studio" is junk,
# so let's remove it
albums[["studio"]][, ncol(albums[["studio"]]) := NULL]

# REMOVE WIKIPEDIA REFERENCES --------------------------------------------------
# Tables are from Wikipedia so all the reference links (such as [12] or [A])
# need to be removed from the data.

remove_references <- function(dt){
  # Takes a data.table and removes every pattern of
  # data where any number (>=1) of alphanumerical characters
  # are inside of brackets, for example, [8].
  #
  # Args:
  #   dt: data.table from where the citation links are removed
  cols <- c(1:ncol(dt)) # Apply to all columns
  dt[,(cols) := # Assign by reference
       lapply(.SD, # Apply function to all columns
       str_remove_all, # Removes all patterns of:
       "\\[[:alnum:]+\\]")] # [ALPHANUM+]
}

# This function will be used a lot in this program
lapply_invis <- function(dts, fun, ...){
  # lapply wrapped inside invisible() to hide printing.
  #
  # Args:
  #   dts: list of data.tables
  #   fun: function to be used
  #   ... : additional parameters
  dts |> # Use all the data.tables
    lapply(fun, ...) |> # Use function and other arguments to all
    invisible() # Hide printing
}

#Remove Wikipedia references from all cells
lapply_invis(albums, remove_references)

# REPLACE NEWLINES WITH SPACES -------------------------------------------------
# Certification columns have newline characters (\n). Replace those with spaces.

replace_all_str_for_cols <- function(dt, cols, s1, s2){
  # Replaces all occurrences of s1 with s2 in specified columns
  #
  # Args:
  #   dt: data.table
  #   col: column name as a string
  #   s1: string to be replaced
  #   s2: string to replace with
  dt[,(cols) := # Assign by reference
       lapply(.SD, # Using subset of dt
              str_replace_all, s1, s2), # Replace all s1 with s2
     .SDcols = cols] # Use these columns
}

# Replace all newlines with spaces in Certifications for all albums
lapply_invis(albums, replace_all_str_for_cols, c("Certifications"), '\\n', ' ')  

# FIXING THE HEADERS -----------------------------------------------------------
# Because all the original html tables have a partial double header, the more
# useful part of header is currently the first row of the table. We'll move the
# first row to be the actual header.

first_row_to_header <- function(dt){
  # Replaces the headers with the first row
  #
  # Args:
  #   dt: data.table
  setnames(dt, # data.table to be used
           as.character( # Convert data.table to a character vector
             dt[1])) # First row will be the new names
}

# Sets first row as headers
lapply_invis(albums, first_row_to_header)

# REMOVE LAST AND FIRST ROW ----------------------------------------------------
# First and last line for all the data.tables are junk, so they need to be
# removed. Currently first lines are just copies of the headers and the last
# lines say: "â€”" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released
# in that territory.

remove_first_and_last_row <- function(dt){
  # Removes the first and last row from a data.table
  #
  # Args:
  #   dt: data.table
  #
  # Returns:
  #   dt: data.table

  dt <- dt[c(-1)] # Remove the first row  
  return(dt)
}

# Removes first and last row for each data.table.
albums = lapply(albums, remove_first_and_last_row)

# EXTRACTING FROM ONE COLUMN TO MAKE THREE--------------------------------------
# All the data.tables (except single) has a column "Album details", which
# contains data such as: "Released: March 1968\nLabel: Reprise".
# We need to extract columns "Year", "Month" and "Label" from "Album details".

album_details_to_three_columns <- function(dt){
  # Removes "Album details" by turning it to three columns: "Year", "Month"
  # and "Label". Changes months to numbers. Puts these new columns after "Title"
  #
  # Args:
  #   dt: data.table
  setnames(dt, "Album details", "Details") # Name changed for easier processing
  
  # Create new columns using assignment by reference and string extracting. 
  dt[,':='( # Use assignment by reference function. Extract following patterns:
    Year = str_extract(Details, "[:digit:]{4}"), # Any exactly four digits 
    Month = str_extract(Details, "(?<=Released: )\\w+"), # Word after "Released: "
    Label = str_extract(Details, "(?<=Label: )\\w+") # Word after "Label: "
  )]
  
  # Change months to numbers, for example, "May" to 5. Match() return NA
  # when it doesn't find a valid month.
  dt[, Month := match(Month, month.name)]
  
  dt[, Details := NULL] # Drop column "Details"

  setcolorder(dt, c("Year", "Month", "Label"), #Move these three columns..
              after = "Title") # ..to be after the "Title".
}

# Removes and turns column "Album details" to "Month", "Year" and "Label"
# columns for data.tables "studio, "live" and "compilation".
lapply_invis(albums[c("studio", "live", "compilation")],
             album_details_to_three_columns)

# UPDATE SINGLES TO BE MORE SIMILAR WITH OTHERS --------------------------------
# Currently single has some differences with other data.tables, which are
# fixed here.

# Create a new column Title from Single but with double quotes removed
albums[["single"]][, "Title" := str_remove_all(Single, '\\"')]

# Drop Single
albums[["single"]][,"Single" := NULL]

# Move Title to the first position.
setcolorder(albums[["single"]], "Title", before = "Year")

# YEAR AND MONTH TO NUMERIC ----------------------------------------------------
# Changes Year and Month columns to numeric

update_to_valid_cols <- function(dt, cols){
  # Returns only columns that exist in the data.table.
  # For example, "single" doesn't have "Month", so from
  # c("Year", "Month") only c("Year") would be returned.
  # Args:
  #   dt: data.table  
  #   cols: list of columns
  #
  # Returns:
  #   a character vector of existing column names
  return(cols[cols %in% names(dt)])
}

change_column_types <- function(dt, cols, fun){
  # Changes column types of data.table based on fun. Updates only those cols
  # that are found in the data.table.
  #
  # Args:
  #   dt: data.table  
  #   cols: columns we want to coerce to a different type
  #   fun: coercing function (such as as.numeric)
  
  # Rebuild cols to only have the columns that exist in the data.table
  cols <- update_to_valid_cols(dt, cols)
  
  # Coerce all the columns in the cols to the type defined in fun.
  dt[, (cols) := lapply(.SD, fun), .SDcols = cols]
}

# Change the data types of "Year" and "Month" to numeric
lapply_invis(albums, change_column_types, c("Year", "Month"), as.numeric)

# SET KEYS AND INDICES ---------------------------------------------------------
# To speed up future queries, we set keys and indices.

set_keys <- function(dt, cols){
  # Sets keys to the data.table. Only sets those keys that exist as columns
  # in the data.table
  # Args:
  #   dt: data.table  
  #   cols: character vector of columns to use as keys
  cols <- update_to_valid_cols(dt, cols) # Update cols to only valid columns
  setkeyv(dt, cols) # Sets keys
}

# Set Title as a secondary index for all the data.tables
lapply(albums, setindex, "Title")

# ADD NUMBER OF SINGLES PER STUDIO ALBUM ---------------------------------------
# Let's calculate the number of singles from single and add it to studio.
# There are many ways to do this. I'm going to create a temporary data.table
# called album_and_singles just for the sake of clarity and join it with studio.

# .EACHI groups by i, .N contains the number of rows in each group
album_and_singles <- albums[["single"]][albums[["studio"]],
                                        .("Singles" = .N),

# Join the tables

                                         on = c(Title = "Album")]

# This would be the same thing without creating the extra data.table:
# studio <- studio[single[studio, .("N_of_singles" = .N),
# by=.EACHI, on = c(Album = "Title")], on = c(Title = "Album")]

# Sets Singles after Label
setcolorder(albums[["studio"]], c("Singles"), after = c("Label"))

# SINGLES AS COLUMNS FOR EACH ALBUM --------------------------------------------
# We want to create a data.table which contains singles as columns
# (Single_1, etc) for their albums. Each album has 1-3 singles.

# Get Album and Title columns
album_and_singles <- albums[["single"]][, .(Album, Title)]

album_and_singles[, Single := #Create a new column with the walrus operator
                    paste0("Single_", # Create a string starting with "Single_"
                           1:.N), # String ends with a sequential ID.
                  by = Album] # Group by album to match .N with N of singles

# Using dcast to achieve "long to wide" operation. 
album_and_singles <- dcast(album_and_singles, Album ~ Single,
                           value.var = c("Title"))

# Currently album_and_singles isn't ordered. Let's add Year and Month for each
# album. Since some albums are studio and some live, we'll row bind them first.
studio_and_live <- rbind(albums[["studio"]][,.(Title, Year, Month)],
                         albums[["live"]][,.(Title, Year, Month)])

# Add Year and Month columns from studio_and_live

                  on = c(Album = "Title")]

# Sets Year and Month to be located after Album
setcolorder(album_and_singles, c("Year", "Month"), after = c("Album"))

# Sets keys Year and Month to order the data and allow fast searches
setkey(album_and_singles, Year, Month)
